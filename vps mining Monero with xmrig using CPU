vps mining Monero with xmrig using CPU


Before we start installing XMRig on our Ubuntu 20.04 machine, we need to do some initial maintenance and install some dependencies. So, log in to your machine and execute following commands to update apt cache.
	# apt update
	# apt upgrade
It can take a minute or two. Once that’s done, let’s do some cleanup,
	# apt autoremove
Then a reboot,
	# reboot
Log in to your server again when it comes back online. Now we can install the XMRig dependencies with following command.
	# apt-get install git build-essential cmake automake libtool autoconf
Let it complete and then we’re ready to install XMRig on Ubuntu 20.04.
	# Install XMRig CPU Miner on Ubuntu 20.04
We will be fetching the miner directly from the official Github repository. We can use git clone command for that. Let’s do it,

	# git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git
Create the working directory build and then navigate to the scripts directory.

	# mkdir xmrig/build && cd xmrig/scripts
Run the installation script and the navigate to build directory

	# ./build_deps.sh && cd ../build
Install XMRig on Ubuntu 20.04

	# cmake .. -DXMRIG_DEPS=scripts/deps
	# make -j$(nproc)
Two commands above will take bit longer to process. You are ready to mine Monero on Ubuntu 20.04 once its complete.

Start mining Monero with XMRig CPU Miner on Ubuntu 20.04
If you were able to complete the above instructions successfully, you’re now ready to mine XMR on your Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 18.04 machine. There are two methods you can use the miner. The first method is by,

Using command line…
This is not the preferred way to use the miner. We’ll be passing the arguments directly from the command line with a single command. Following is the command to use,

	# /root/xmrig/build/./xmrig -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://pool.supportxmr.com:5555 -u MoneroAddress -p MinerIdentifier:Email -t 1
This will mine Monero on supportxmr.com with 1 CPU. Change your MoneroAddress, MinerIdentifier, Email and the number of treads with the -t vaule towards the end.

The second and the preferred method is by,

Using JSON config file…
In this method, we’ll store miner config in a json file. Let’s create it in the build directory,

	# nano /root/xmrig/build/config.json
Now use the configuration wizard to generate your XMRig miner configuration. Paste the output from wizard to the config.json file. It should look something like this,

{
    "autosave": true,
    "cpu": true,
    "opencl": false,
    "cuda": false,
    "pools": [
        {
            "url": "pool.supportxmr.com:443",
            "user": "4A5Zv5vpNcG4Tk7pF6wRHha6jZEgoF9UgFv49qijdHxeLSLYCWyCbHZA6sqBiWRSwcBcnBrJuEWxjYgtwJAQnzcT3BDvq8m",
            "pass": "test",
            "keepalive": true,
            "tls": true
        }
    ]
}
Now close the file by hitting +. Following command will launch the miner and start mining Monero on Ubuntu 20.04.

	# /root/xmrig/build/./xmrig
